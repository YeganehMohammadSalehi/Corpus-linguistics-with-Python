## Project Description

This Python module analyzes text corpora within a specified directory. It performs various analyses on individual documents and the entire corpus. The project demonstrates these capabilities using a corpus containing at least 100,000 tokens.

## Features

1. **Corpora Statistics**
   - Number of Documents
   - Number of Lines
   - Number of Tokens (Words)

2. **Term Frequency**
   - Frequency of each term (word) in individual documents and the entire corpus.

3. **Type-Token Ratio**
   - Type-token ratio for individual documents and the entire corpus.

4. **N-Grams Analysis**
   - Unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams for individual documents and the entire corpus.

5. **Concordance**
   - Concordance for a user-specified word in individual documents and the entire corpus.

6. **Collocations / Multiword Expressions**
   - Identification of collocations and multiword expressions.

7. **Unique Word List**
   - Unique words for each document and the entire corpus.
